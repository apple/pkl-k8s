/// MutatingAdmissionPolicyBinding binds the MutatingAdmissionPolicy with parametrized resources.
///
/// MutatingAdmissionPolicyBinding and the optional parameter resource together define how cluster administrators configure policies for clusters.
///
/// For a given admission request, each binding will cause its policy to be evaluated N times, where N is 1 for policies/bindings that don't use params, otherwise N is the number of parameters selected by the binding.
/// Each evaluation is constrained by a [runtime cost budget](<https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/cel/#runtime-cost-budget).>
///
/// Adding/removing policies, bindings, or params can not affect whether a given (policy, binding, param) combination is within its own CEL budget.
