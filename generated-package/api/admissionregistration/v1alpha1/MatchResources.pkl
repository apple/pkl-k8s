/// matchPolicy defines how the "MatchResources" list is used to match incoming requests.

/// Allowed values are "Exact" or "Equivalent".
/// 
/// - Exact: match a request only if it exactly matches a specified rule.
/// For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, but "rules" only included `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`, a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would not be sent to the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy.
/// 
/// - Equivalent: match a request if modifies a resource listed in rules, even via another API group or version.
/// For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, and "rules" only included `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`, a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would be converted to apps/v1 and sent to the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy.
