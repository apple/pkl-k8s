/// Effect indicates the taint effect to match.
///
/// Empty means match all taint effects.
/// When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule and NoExecute.
effect: String?

/// TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint.
///
/// By default, it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict).
/// Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.
/// If larger than zero, the time when the pod needs to be evicted is calculated as <time when taint was adedd> + <toleration seconds>.
tolerationSeconds: Int?

/// Value is the taint value the toleration matches to.
///
/// If the operator is Exists, the value must be empty, otherwise just a regular string.
/// Must be a label value.
value: String?

/// Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to.
///
/// Empty means match all taint keys.
/// If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.
/// Must be a label name.
key: String?

/// Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.
///
/// Valid operators are Exists and Equal.
/// Defaults to Equal.
/// Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a ResourceClaim can tolerate all taints of a particular category.
operator: String?
