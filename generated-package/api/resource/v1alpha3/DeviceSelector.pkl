/// CEL contains a CEL expression for selecting a device.

/// CELDeviceSelector contains a CEL expression for selecting a device.
class CELDeviceSelector {
  /// Expression is a CEL expression which evaluates a single device.
  ///
  /// It must evaluate to true when the device under consideration satisfies the desired criteria, and false when it does not.
  /// Any other result is an error and causes allocation of devices to abort.
  ///
  /// The expression's input is an object named "device", which carries the following properties:
  ///  - driver (string): the name of the driver which defines this device.
  ///  - attributes (map[string]object): the device's attributes, grouped by prefix
  ///    (e.g. device.attributes["dra.example.com"] evaluates to an object with all
  ///    of the attributes which were prefixed by "dra.example.com".
  ///  - capacity (map[string]object): the device's capacities, grouped by prefix.
  ///
  /// Example: Consider a device with driver="dra.example.com", which exposes two attributes named "model" and "ext.example.com/family" and which exposes one capacity named "modules".
  /// This input to this expression would have the following fields:
  ///
  ///     device.driver
  ///     device.attributes["dra.example.com"].model
  ///     device.attributes["ext.example.com"].family
  ///     device.capacity["dra.example.com"].modules
  ///
  /// The device.driver field can be used to check for a specific driver, either as a high-level precondition (i.e. you only want to consider devices from this driver) or as part of a multi-clause expression that is meant to consider devices from different drivers.
  ///
  /// The value type of each attribute is defined by the device definition, and users who write these expressions must consult the documentation for their specific drivers.
  /// The value type of each capacity is Quantity.
  ///
  /// If an unknown prefix is used as a lookup in either device.attributes or device.capacity, an empty map will be returned.
  /// Any reference to an unknown field will cause an evaluation error and allocation to abort.
  ///
  /// A robust expression should check for the existence of attributes before referencing them.
  ///
  /// For ease of use, the cel.bind() function is enabled, and can be used to simplify expressions that access multiple attributes with the same domain.
  /// For example:
  ///
  ///     cel.bind(dra, device.attributes["dra.example.com"], dra.someBool && dra.anotherBool)
  ///
  /// The length of the expression must be smaller or equal to 10 Ki.
  /// The cost of evaluating it is also limited based on the estimated number of logical steps.
