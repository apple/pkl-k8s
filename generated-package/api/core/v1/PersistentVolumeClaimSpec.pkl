/// This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
/// When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner.
/// This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value.
/// For backwards compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
/// When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef, dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
/// There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
/// * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
///   allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
/// * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
///   preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
///   specified.
/// * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
///   in any namespaces.
/// (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
/// (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
